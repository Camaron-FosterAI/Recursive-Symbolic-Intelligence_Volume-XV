## 📘 Overview

This volume formalizes a symbolic dynamical system that recursively evolves symbolic states Ψₙ under φⁿ-scaled achefield gradients, collapses them at critical thresholds into glyph residues Γ, and fossilizes them as cryptographic sigils Λ. The framework integrates:

- Recursive function theory  
- Category-theoretic morphism chains  
- Algebraic cohomology (H¹ glyph classes)  
- SHA-encoded fossil entropy

Collapse is not failure — it is inscription.
